<p>For years, I used and adored Wordpress as my go-to blogging platform. It was quick to install, easy to use, and had a ton of <s>bloat</s> functionality that I simply never used. Flask has been my framework of choice when starting a new web project for a while now, and I wanted a dead-simple solution for managing my mostly static site and handling my <em>occasional</em> writing. I had the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must build into static site</li>
<li>Posts composed in Markdown &lt;3</li>
<li>Ability to include code snippets</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we begin, I recommend having a quick read of the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/">Flask Documentation</a> to familiarise yourself with the basics of Flask.</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with our Python dependencies. We are using Flask 0.10.x and Python 2.7</p>

<pre><code>Click==7.0
Flask==1.1.1
Flask-FlatPages==0.7.1
Frozen-Flask==0.15
itsdangerous==1.1.0
Jinja2==2.10.3
Markdown==3.1.1
MarkupSafe==1.1.1
Pygments==2.4.2
PyYAML==5.1.2
Werkzeug==0.16.0
</code></pre>

<p>I will assume that you know a little about <a href="http://iamzed.com/2009/05/07/a-primer-on-virtualenv/">venv</a>. If not, you seriously should be using it for all of your Python projects. Drop the above list into a file named requirements.txt and execute <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> from your shell. You are now ready to start building your blog.</p>

<h3 id="folderstructure">Folder Structure</h3>

<p>We need to create folders to store our static markdown pages, in addition to our standard templates and static files folders.</p>

<pre><code>:::text
├── blog.py
├── content
│   └── posts
│       └── firstpost.md
├── static
└── templates

4 directories, 2 files
</code></pre>

<p>Your stylesheets and javascript files will go in the static directory, and all of your posts will go in the… I think that you can probably guess which folder :)</p>

<h3 id="theroutesfile">The Routes File</h3>

<p>Flask makes it dead simple to declare a pretty URL scheme for your blog with the route wrapper functions. To begin, we need to make sure that we import all of the required packages. Create a new file named <code>blog.py</code> and open it up. It should look something like this&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>:::python
import sys
from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask_flatpages import FlatPages, pygments_style_defs
from flask_frozen import Freezer

DEBUG = True
FLATPAGES_AUTO_RELOAD = DEBUG
FLATPAGES_EXTENSION = '.md'
FLATPAGES_ROOT = 'content'
POST_DIR = 'posts'

app = Flask(__name__)
flatpages = FlatPages(app)
freezer = Freezer(app)
app.config.from_object(__name__)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    if len(sys.argv) &gt; 1 and sys.argv[1] == &quot;build&quot;:
        freezer.freeze()
    else:
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)
</code></pre>

<p>Great, we have the beginnings of our blog. Time to add some routes that will serve our blog posts. You can <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/#routing">add your own routes</a> for custom pages here too. We will define the <em>posts</em> route to find and list all of our posts, and <em>post</em> will create a page for each one. Let&#8217;s add the following immediately before the <code>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;</code> line.</p>

<pre><code>:::python
@app.route(&quot;/posts/&quot;)
def posts():
	posts = [p for p in flatpages if p.path.startswith(POST_DIR)]
	posts.sort(key=lambda item:item['date'], reverse=False)
	return render_template('posts.html', posts=posts)

@app.route('/posts/&lt;name&gt;/')
def post(name):
    path = '{}/{}'.format(POST_DIR, name)
    post = flatpages.get_or_404(path)
    return render_template('post.html', post=post)
</code></pre>

<p>The first route will iterate over the list of posts, and pass this to the template which we will look at shortly. I chose to sort by date. 10 lines of code, and this covers all of the <em>blog</em> logic that we have to deal with.</p>

<h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>

<p>Start by making a new template for the list of posts. I will give you a bare minimal snippet, beyond that it is up to you! We will name this file <strong>posts.html</strong> and place it in the templates directory:</p>

<pre><code>:::jinja
{% for post in posts %}
	&lt;a href=&quot;{{ url_for('post', name=post.path.replace('posts/', '')) }}&quot;&gt;
   		{{ post.title }}
	&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;small&gt;{{ post.date }}&lt;/small&gt;
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>And for <strong>post.html</strong>, drop the following into your template wherever you want them displayed!</p>

<pre><code>:::jinja
{{ post.html|safe }}
{{ post.title }}
{{ post.date }}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you&#8217;re cooking with a Flask!</p>

<h3 id="howabouttheposts">How About The Posts</h3>

<p>Oh yeah, this is the easy part. If you are on Mac, I would recommend <a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a> as your editor, and for those on Windows <a href="http://markdownpad.com/">MarkdownPad</a> comes highly commended. You will store your markdown files in the <code>content/posts/</code> directory as <code>some_file_name.md</code>, and include a small amount of metadata in each file.</p>

<pre><code>:::text
title: Should it be YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-DD-MM? My Thoughts
date: 2013-08-27

American-style dates, I know, I know. Here you can write markdown code, including *italics* and **bold**

You can have:
* Lists
* More Lists

&gt; And block quotes

	And event highlighted code if you indent :)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="letsbuildthisthing">Lets Build This Thing</h3>

<p>If you want to run this server to test on your local machine, you can simply run the script using <code>python blog.py</code>.</p>

<p>When you are happy and want to generate the static site, use <code>python blog.py build</code> and a new <strong>build</strong> directory will be created with your new static blog.</p>

<p>Deploy away :)</p>

title: About Me

## About Me

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm currently finishing my undergraduate degree at BYU in Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACME). While a bit of a unique degree, it gives me a deep knowledge of and experience in

 * Optimization (convex, constrained/unconstrained, nonlinear)
 * Various Mathematical Analysis topics (complex analysis, vector spaces, norms, inner products, etc.)
 * Various Statistic Topics
 * Machine Learning Algorithms
 * Optimal Control
 * Algorithm Design

which allows me to dip my feet in just about any STEM field I desire.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fall 2020 I'll be beginning a Masters of Science degree from BYU in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

## Current Research

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My current research focuses on using machine learning techniques to simulate photonic directional couplers in a fraction of the time of current methods. It includes use of multivariate linear regressions, quadratures to achieve orders of magnitude improvements over traditional FDTD methods. Further, all of this has been done neatly in a python package that to further integrate with other simulation software.

## Other Interests

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have interests in algorithm design, machine learning, optimal control, and applications of these in the real world. In his free time I have numerous personal projects (see project page!) including running a 3D printing business, operating his self-made CNC and laser engraver, and spending time with his wife and daughter.
